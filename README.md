aCap
====

An electronic cap based on the LilyPad Arduino for detecting and transmitting head movements to emulate a computer mouse (and do some other stuff ;-).

aCap was originally developed to be used as an assistive technology device for people with severe physical disabilities, like tetraplegia.

Hardware
--------

- 1 x LilyPad Arduino Main Board (http://lilypadarduino.org/?p=128);
- 1 x LilyPad RGB LED (http://lilypadarduino.org/?p=519);
- 1 x LilyPad Buzzer (http://lilypadarduino.org/?p=436);
- 1 x LilyPad Vibe Board (http://lilypadarduino.org/?p=514);
- 1 x LilyPad LiPower module (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/11260) and a Polymer Lithium Ion Battery (for example, a 1000mAh will work: http://www.sparkfun.com/products/339);
(Note: Of course you will need a LyPo charger like the http://www.sparkfun.com/products/12711 but I didn't included it here, since it is not attached to the device, what means the battery should be charged before connecting it to the LiPower module.)
- 1 x 3-axis Compass and Accelerometer combined I2C sensor - for example, I used the very handy Pololu board LSM303DLH 3D Carrier with Voltage Regulators (http://www.pololu.com/product/1250);
- 1 x Bluetooth to Serial Port Module - I used the "MÃ³dulo Bluetooth para microcontroladores" board from Tato (http://www.tato.ind.br/produto/M%F3dulo-Bluetooth-para-microcontroladores.html - in Portuguese) which is based on the iTead Studio HC-05 board (http://imall.iteadstudio.com/im120723009.html) adapted for a 5V power supply and other convenient features;
- 4 x standard 3.5mm female audio jacks to plug the external buttons (mono or stereo, depending on what you want to connect; for example: if your button requires power, use the stereo conector, otherwise the mono will work);
- 4 x standard 3.5mm male audio jacks to connect the external buttons (mono or stereo, just like above);
- 4 x external buttons (be creative, that's why the buttons are external from the device ;-).

You will also need an FTDI Basic Breakout board (e.g. https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716) and USB cable to load the software into your LilyPad Arduino.

Hookup Guide
------------

In a very quick and simplified way, everything should be connected like this:

1) Connect the LilyPad RGB LED module:

		Arduino      Output
		-------------------
		     5V  ->  + petal
		     11  ->  R petal
		      9  ->  G petal
		     10  ->  B petal

2) Connect the LilyPad Buzzer:

		Arduino      Output
		-------------------
		     13  ->  + petal
		    GND  ->  - petal

3) Connect the LilyPad Vibe Board:

		Arduino      Output
		-------------------
		      8  ->  + petal
		    GND  ->  - petal

4) Connect the Compass and Accelerometer board (of course, it will depend on the board you choose to use):

		Arduino      LSM303 board
		-------------------------
		     5V  ->  VIN
		    GND  ->  GND
		     A4  ->  SDA
		     A5  ->  SCL

5) Connect the Bluetooth to Serial Port Module (of course, it will depend on the board you choose to use):
	 
		Arduino      Tato's Bluetooth board
		-----------------------------------
		     5V  ->  VCC
		    GND  ->  GND
		 0 (Rx)  ->  Tx
		 1 (Tx)  ->  Rx
	 
6) Connect the 3.5mm female audio jacks for the input buttons to the Arduino digital input pins:

		Arduino      Female jack 
		------------------------
		      2  ->  the tip of the audio jack for button 1
		      3  ->  the tip of the audio jack for button 2
		      4  ->  the tip of the audio jack for button 3
		      5  ->  the tip of the audio jack for button 4
		    GND  ->  the sleeve of all other tips of all the above jacks
		     5V  ->  the middle ring of the above jacks
	 
7) External buttons:

		Hook the male audio jacks to each one of the buttons you choose to use so you can
		plug them into the female jacks above.
	 
External dependencies
---------------------

You will need the following Arduino libraries:
- Kalman.h: A simplified one dimensional Kalman filter implementation for Arduino --> http://github.com/bachagas/Kalman
- lsm303-arduino: Arduino library for Pololu LSM303 boards --> http://github.com/bachagas/lsm303-arduino 

Installation
------------

Download the archive from GitHub, decompress it, and use it :)
Make sure you have all the libraries above correctly installed in your Arduino development environment.

Output
------

Detectable movements will be:
- Roll (bend head left-right): from accelerometer y-axis
- Pitch (bend head forwards-backwards): from accelerometer x-axis
- Nod / yaw (turn head left-right: from compass x-axis

When activated, the device will send through Bluetooth an output containing:

- "*" --> stands for comment lines, for example, the device will print that immediately after activation:

		*** Sensitivity is: 100
		*** Filter parameters are: 0.09800,91.00000,0.00000 - 0.09800,91.00000,0.00000 - 0.09800,91.00000,0.00000
		*** Reference values are: -1419,2729,-30
		                                 |__ stands for the initial sensor values that will be used as reference values when detecting relative moves: Nod, Pitch, Roll respectively

- a 7-tuple comma separated string like this:

		0,0,0,0,0,0,0
		| | | | | | |__ Button 4 state: 1 pressed, 0 released
		| | | | | |____ Button 3 state: 1 pressed, 0 released
		| | | | |______ Button 2 state: 1 pressed, 0 released
		| | | |________ Button 1 state: 1 pressed, 0 released
		| | |__________ Nod move (relative to reference value): left + <-- 0 --> - right
		| |____________ Pitch move (relative to reference value): backwards (up) - <-- 0 --> + front (down)
		|______________ Roll move (relative to reference value): left + <-- 0 --> - right

Example:

		*** Reference values are: -1387,2782,-25
		*** Sensitivity is: 100
		*** Filter parameters are: 0.09800,91.00000,0.00000 - 0.09800,91.00000,0.00000 - 0.09800,91.00000,0.00000
		*** Reference values are: -1419,2729,-30
		0,0,0,0,0,0,0
		0,0,0,0,0,0,0
		0,1,0,0,0,0,0
		0,0,0,0,0,0,0
		-1,0,0,0,0,0,0
		0,1,0,0,0,0,0
		-1,1,0,0,0,0,0
		-1,3,0,0,0,0,0
		1,3,1,0,0,0,0
		-2,3,1,0,0,0,0
		-3,6,1,0,0,0,0
		-1,7,1,0,0,0,0
